 # Breast Cancer Analysis

## Project Overview
 This project analyzes breast cancer data using Power BI to identify key trends, patient demographics, and survival rates. The goal is to help medical researchers and healthcare professionals make data-driven 
 decisions.  

  ## Tools Used
  Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation
  Power Query - Data Cleaning and Transformation
  
  ## Data Set
  The dataset includes:  
- Patient demographics (age, gender, location)  
- Diagnosis details (tumor size, stage, metastasis)  
- Treatment responses and survival rates  

**Dataset Source:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhumikatandon/breastcancerdata]  

## Key Insights
- Age Group at Highest Risk: Majority of diagnosed patients are in the 50-60 age range.  
- Survival Rate Trends: Early detection leads to a 90%+ survival rate, while late-stage diagnoses reduce survival rates significantly.  
- Most Common Cancer Type: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most frequently diagnosed type.  
- Treatment Effectiveness: Chemotherapy combined with surgery shows the highest recovery rate.  
- Regional Diagnosis Patterns: Higher cases are reported in urban areas, possibly due to better screening access.

  ## Power BI Dashboard

  The interactive dashboard provides:
   Diagnosis Breakdow – Cancer types, severity distribution  
  Survival Rate Analysis – Impact of early vs. late detection  
  Treatment Effectivenes – Comparison of different treatments  
  Geographical Trends – Cases by region
