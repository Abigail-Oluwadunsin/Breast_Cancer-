# Breast Cancer Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes breast cancer data using **Power BI** to identify key trends, patient demographics, and survival rates. The goal is to help medical researchers and healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions.  

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Power Query** - Data Cleaning and Transformation

  ## Data Set
  The dataset includes:  
- Patient demographics (age, gender, location)  
- Diagnosis details (tumor size, stage, metastasis)  
- Treatment responses and survival rates  

**Dataset Source:** []  

## Key Insights
- **Age Group at Highest Risk:** Majority of diagnosed patients are in the **50-60 age range**.  
- **Survival Rate Trends:** **Early detection** leads to a **90%+ survival rate**, while late-stage diagnoses reduce survival rates significantly.  
- **Most Common Cancer Type:** **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)** is the most frequently diagnosed type.  
- **Treatment Effectiveness:** **Chemotherapy combined with surgery** shows the highest recovery rate.  
- **Regional Diagnosis Patterns:** Higher cases are reported in **urban areas**, possibly due to better screening access.

  ## Power BI Dashboard
  ![Dashboard Preview]()
  The interactive dashboard provides:
    **Diagnosis Breakdown** – Cancer types, severity distribution  
    **Survival Rate Analysis** – Impact of early vs. late detection  
    **Treatment Effectiveness** – Comparison of different treatments  
    **Geographical Trends** – Cases by region
